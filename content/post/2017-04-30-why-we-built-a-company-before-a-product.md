Hello, cutie another day has gone by with me struggling to fin d the best way to show u this and i still have not not overcome my perfectionism.  I almost gave up after it all crashed 2 days ago but then i remembered this could possibly make u smile. So i decided if i could provoke a smile a day my world would be brighter everyday. You would be brighter every day. This is probably the latest gift of all times but i dont regret the time and effort if it can make u smile.

Love cutie
